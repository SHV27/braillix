/**
 * BRF — Braille Ready Format, the file an embosser eats.
 *
 * A refreshable display is one cell at a time. Paper is thirty lines at once, it costs nothing to
 * read again tomorrow, and it goes home in a bag. A school that owns an embosser (or has a friend
 * who does) should be able to take a worksheet a teacher wrote here and press it onto paper, and
 * that is one small file away.
 *
 * BRF is deliberately dumb: ASCII, one character per braille cell, in the North American Braille
 * ASCII character set that every embosser has understood since the 1970s. Forty cells to a line and
 * twenty-five lines to a page are the defaults every embosser expects; both are arguments here
 * because school embossers are not all the same.
 *
 * The table below is the standard one, indexed by dot mask — dot 1 is bit 0, exactly as everywhere
 * else in Braillix. `brf.test.ts` checks it against the letters a braille reader knows by heart.

 * six) is "=". Those three are enough to catch a table that has been shifted or reversed.
