/**
 * Words and maths on one line.
 *
 * The tests that matter most here are the two "must not change" ones: a pure maths line has to come
 * out byte-identical to what the Nemeth pipeline produced before this file existed, and a pure text
 * line must never acquire a maths indicator. Everything Braillix already did has to keep working
 * exactly as it did, or this feature is a regression wearing a feature's clothes.
