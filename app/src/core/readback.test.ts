/**
 * Can the dots be read back?
 *
 * Two kinds of test here, and the second matters more than the first.
 *
 * The first kind checks the reading against Nemeth by hand: braille written out from the published
 * code, and what it says. Ordinary correctness.
 *
 * The second kind attacks the check itself. A round-trip that always agrees proves nothing — it
 * could be a function that returns whatever it was given. So these tests break the braille on
 * purpose, one cell at a time, in the exact ways Nemeth goes wrong in practice: a missing baseline
 * indicator, a superscript written as a subscript, a numeric indicator dropped after a letter, a
 * fraction left open. Every one of them must produce a *different* reading. A guard has two failure
 * modes — accepting the false and rejecting the true — and both are tested here, on the day it
 * ships (CLAUDE.md Law 7, and the two-sided-honesty rule in ARCHITECTURE.md).
