/**
 * Literal braille — the last resort, and a small feature in its own right.
 *
 * `ARCHITECTURE.md` promised that if the maths engine ever fails, the display would fall back to a
 * literal rendering rather than going blank. That promise was written before this file existed,
 * which made it a claim rather than a behaviour — exactly the sort of documented-but-unbuilt gap
 * that turns into a nasty surprise. So here it is.
 *
 * This is **uncontracted (Grade 1) English braille**, not Nemeth. It is deliberately simple: the
 * standard letter, digit and punctuation cells, a capital indicator, and a number sign. It cannot
 * express a fraction or an exponent and does not pretend to — when it is used, the interface says
 * so, because braille that silently means something different from what the reader expects is
 * worse than no braille at all.
 *
 * It is also genuinely useful on its own: a student writing their name, a teacher labelling a
 * worksheet. Maths is what Braillix is for, but text is what surrounds it.
