/**
 * Can Braillix carry the actual syllabus?
 *
 * Not "does Nemeth work" — that is `nemeth.test.ts`, against the published tables. This asks the
 * question a head teacher would ask: take the maths my school teaches, typed the way my teachers
 * type, and show me that all of it reaches the display. Seventy lines, from a single digit to a
 * definite integral, plus word problems in both languages.
 *
 * When this file writes `docs/ACCURACY.md` (via `npm run accuracy`) it is producing evidence rather
 * than decoration: the same list, with what each line actually became, so a panel can check a cell
 * against a published table without running anything.
