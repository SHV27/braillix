/**
 * Reading the dots back.
 *
 * Everything else in `core/` runs one way: maths goes in, braille comes out. Which means that when
 * the braille is wrong, nothing in the system notices — the tests can only check that a translation
 * *happened*, and a teacher who cannot read braille has no way to tell a correct cell from a
 * plausible one. That is an uncomfortable position for a tool whose whole job is to be trusted.
 *
 * So this file reads in the other direction: braille cells in, ordinary maths out. It is a small
 * Nemeth parser that knows nothing about temml, nothing about speech-rule-engine, and nothing about
 * how the forward path decided anything. Feed it the cells that are physically on the display and
 * it says what a braille reader would say they mean.
 *
 * WHAT AGREEMENT PROVES, AND WHAT IT DOES NOT.
 *
 * The two directions share the alphabet — a Nemeth "5" is dots 2-6 in both, and no amount of
 * round-tripping can discover that both are wrong about that. (`nemeth.test.ts` checks the alphabet
 * against published tables; that is its job, not this one's.) What the two directions do *not*
 * share is the grammar: numeric indicators, where a superscript ends, which cell closes a fraction,
 * whether a lone digit after a letter is a subscript. That is where braille goes wrong in practice,
 * and every one of those is checked here by two pieces of code that were written from opposite
 * ends and have to arrive at the same sentence.
 *
 * THE READING IS A CANONICAL FORM, NOT PRETTY MATHS. Everything is parenthesised — `(1)/(2)`,
 * `x^(2)` — because the point is comparison, not beauty, and an unparenthesised reading would let
 * a genuine grouping bug slip through as a formatting difference. `canonical.ts` prints LaTeX into
 * the same form so the two can be compared character for character.
 *
 * Nemeth rules this file implements, with the case in the corpus that forced each one:
 *
 *   · dropped digits ⠂⠆⠒⠲⠢⠖⠶⠦⠔⠴, distinct from the letters a–j        `2 + 3 = 5`
 *   · the numeric indicator ⠼, and the fact that ⠼ is ALSO the fraction
 *     closing cell — told apart by whether a digit follows it              `1/2` vs `2/3 + 1/6`
 *   · a digit straight after a letter is a subscript, no indicator needed   `x_1`, `log_10 100`
 *   · levels: ⠘ up, ⠰ down, ⠐ back to the baseline, and a space also
 *     returns to the baseline                                              `(a+b)^2 = a^2 + ...`
 *   · fractions ⠹ … ⠌ … ⠼, and the "complex fraction" ⠠⠹ … ⠠⠌ … ⠠⠼
 *     one level out when a fraction contains a fraction                    `3/4 x 2/5`
 *   · radicals ⠜ … ⠻, with the index written ⠣ n ⠜ before the sign         `cbrt(27)`
 *   · limits written below ⠩ and above ⠣, closed by ⠻                      `sum_{i=1}^{n}`
 *   · ⠨ before a digit inside a number is a decimal point, but ⠨⠂ standing
 *     alone is "greater than" — the same two cells, told apart by context   `3.14` vs `a > b`
