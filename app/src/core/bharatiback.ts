/**
 * Reading Bharati Braille back into words.
 *
 * The maths half of a question could already be checked — `readback.ts` reads the Nemeth cells and
 * says what they mean, and the Board screen shows the verdict. The words half could not, so the
 * panel had to narrow its claim to "the maths matches" and say plainly that nothing had looked at
 * the Hindi. This file closes that, and lets a whole question be verified end to end.
 *
 * WHAT MAKES THIS HARDER THAN NEMETH. Bharati Braille is a six-dot code carrying a script with far
 * more than sixty-four distinctions, so several cells genuinely mean two things, and the reader
 * settles them the way a person does — by where they are:
 *
 *   ⠼  is BOTH the letter ण and the number sign. At the start of a word it opens a number; inside
 *      one it is ण, which is why गणित is ⠛⠼⠊⠞ and not a number with letters glued to it.
 *   ⠊  is the vowel इ standing alone, and the matra ि when it follows a consonant. Bharati has no
 *      diacritics: a matra is written as the whole vowel letter, and the position tells you which.
 *   ⠐  is the nukta, and the prefix of ऋ and ऌ. The cell after it decides.
 *   ⠠  is the visarga, and the prefix of ॠ. Visarga wins — ॠ is not a letter Hindi uses.
 *
 * AND WHAT NO READER CAN SETTLE. A handful of distinctions are not in the braille at all: ॅ and ॆ
 * are one cell, so are ऽ and ँ, so are ऱ and ऋ. Those are properties of the code, not defects in
 * this file, and pretending otherwise would make the verdict cry wolf over ordinary words. They are
 * listed in `fold()` below — that function is the honest, written-down statement of exactly what
 * Bharati Braille does not preserve, and it is applied to BOTH sides of every comparison.
