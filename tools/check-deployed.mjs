 * Check the thing that is actually published, not the thing that was built.
 *
 * A local build passing proves the local build passes. Between it and a teacher there is an install
 * step, a build command, a set of headers and a CDN — and every one of those has a way of being
 * subtly wrong that no test on this laptop can see. So this fetches the live site and asserts the
 * few facts that would make it useless if they were false:
 *
 *   · the page is there, and it is Braillix
 *   · the service worker is there, is not cached forever, and precaches the Nemeth tables
 *   · the Nemeth tables themselves are there, and are the real ones
 *   · the manifest and icons are there, so it can be installed
 *   · the handwriting model is honestly reported as absent rather than 404-ing
